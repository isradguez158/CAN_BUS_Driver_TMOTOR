# CAN_BUS_Driver_TMOTOR
Arduino Driver for T-Motor Actuators

CubeMars, in association with TMotor, offers the AK-series actuators. These actuators are equipped with a driver chip that effectively handles the motor control at a low level. They can be controlled through a CAN bus or Serial Port using our open-source library. We have extensively tested this library with the AK80-9 model and expect it to be compatible with all TMotors in the AK-series.
